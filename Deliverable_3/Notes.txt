-- General notes file for questions/concerns -- 

Why are some attributes prepended with "_" but others aren't?

What exactly is race.participants? Composite? Multi-valued?

Is jockey.colors multivalued?

Same with prize.

Horse and winner have foreign keys but other tables don't.

What about relationships?
